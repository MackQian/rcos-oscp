Project:
  Open Source Curriculum Project
Goal:
  As a Framework Expert, I was given the goal of learning about a web framework,
  either FlasK, Django, or NodeJS. I chose to learn Django. Also, I decided to
  also take part in the Curriculum Team and help develop a tutorial. Since I had
  to learn Python for Django, I decided to use Pygame to create the game ideas.
Setup and Installation (LINUX):
  I needed to first install python 3 (My version of linux came with python2),
  after I followed this guide: https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/python-3-django-gunicorn-linux-mint-17.html
  to install django and make a new project

  To install Pygame, I just installed it using pip.
